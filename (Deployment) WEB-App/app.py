This application allows you to use pre-trained deep learning models for inference.
Choose a model from the sidebar to get started.

st.subheader("1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)")
st.write("""
CNNs are specialized neural networks for processing grid-like data, such as images.
They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features.
Use this model for image classification tasks.
""")

st.subheader("2. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)")
st.write("""
RNNs are designed to work with sequence data by maintaining a state (memory) as they process each element.
They are suitable for tasks like time series prediction and text generation.
""")

st.subheader("3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)")
st.write("""
LSTMs are a special kind of RNN designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem.
They excel at learning from data with long time lags between important events.
Use this model for sequence tasks where long-term dependencies are important.
""")

st.subheader("4. Transfer Learning")
st.write("""
Transfer learning involves using pre-trained models (like VGG16, ResNet, etc.) and
fine-tuning them on specific tasks. This approach often yields better results with 
less data and training time.
""")

st.subheader("5. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)")
st.write("""
Basic feed-forward neural networks for general-purpose machine learning tasks.
These models work well with tabular data and can solve classification or regression problems.
