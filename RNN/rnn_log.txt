[2025-03-28 12:35:07] Evaluation: Baseline RNN - Test RMSE: 0.3144
[2025-03-28 12:35:07] Evaluation: Baseline RNN - Test R^2: -150.6509
[2025-03-28 12:36:11] Modeling: Training tuned RNN with LSTM (128, 64 units), dropout 0.3, learning rate 0.0001.
[2025-03-28 12:37:48] Evaluation: Tuned RNN - Test MSE: 0.0570, Test MAE: 0.2374, Test RMSE: 0.2387, Test R^2: -86.4424
[2025-03-28 12:41:36] Visualizing training MAE and loss for baseline and tuned RNN models.
[2025-03-28 12:44:06] Analysis: Tuned RNN reduced MAE by ~0.0640 compared to baseline.
[2025-03-28 12:44:06] Analysis: LSTM layers and dropout improved model generalization on text data.
[2025-03-28 12:44:06] Analysis: Limited epochs (5) used to avoid overfitting; more data could enhance performance.
