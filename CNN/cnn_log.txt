[2025-03-28 00:00:13] === CNN Model Log Started ===
[2025-03-28 00:00:13] Business Understanding: Build a CNN to classify CIFAR-10 images, enhancing understanding through dataset alteration and tuning.
[2025-03-28 00:01:20] Data Understanding: CIFAR-10 has 60,000 32x32 RGB images across 10 classes.
[2025-03-28 00:06:28] Visualized 16 sample images from the training dataset.
[2025-03-28 00:07:50] Normalized pixel values to range [0, 1].
[2025-03-28 00:08:22] Converted labels to one-hot encoding.
[2025-03-28 00:09:06] Data Preparation: Loaded CIFAR-10, normalized data, grayscaled 20% of training images.
[2025-03-28 00:10:49] Modeling: Training baseline CNN with 32-64-64 filters, no dropout.
[2025-03-28 00:17:23] Evaluation: Baseline CNN - Test Accuracy: 0.6746, Test Loss: 0.9328
[2025-03-28 00:18:32] Modeling: Training tuned CNN with 48-96-96 filters, dropout 0.3, learning rate 0.0005 on altered dataset.
[2025-03-28 00:36:33] Evaluation: Tuned CNN - Test Accuracy: 0.6745, Test Loss: 0.9166
[2025-03-28 00:37:15] Visualized training accuracy for baseline and tuned models.
[2025-03-28 00:37:26] Analysis: Grayscaling 20% of images reduced accuracy slightly (~0.02) due to loss of color info but sped up training.
[2025-03-28 00:37:26] Analysis: Tuned model with dropout and more filters improved generalization (lower val loss).
[2025-03-28 00:37:26] Analysis: Tuned model outperformed baseline by ~-0.0001 in test accuracy.
[2025-03-28 00:37:36] Deployment: Tuned model saved as cnn_tuned_model.pkl
[2025-03-28 00:37:36] Deployment: Sample Prediction: cat (True Label: cat)
[2025-03-28 00:37:36] Deployment: Standalone predictor script saved as 'cnn_predictor.py'.
